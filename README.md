This project is in its infancy right now. Please do not judge the project from its name. The functionality will slowly be added

Goals and scope:
As a university student that lives in a student house, managing bills can be tricky, especially when you insist on not paying for an all-inclusive bills package because it's far too expensive in comparison to paying the bills separately. Sometimes people forget to pay their share of the bill, needing you to chase them up on it right before it's due.

The aim of this bot is to build a scheduling system, with a message dedicated to splitting bills, the total amount due, and the amount each person owes. Once scheduled, the bot will send a reminder 7 days prior to the due date of the bill. People will be able to indicate they have paid by hitting an emote reaction on the bot. The bot will use this information to work out who hasn't paid their bills and send another reminder 3 days prior to the due date, and to whoever that hasn't paid it yet, it will DM them a day before the due date.

Long term goal is to build a dynamic embedded messaging interface that changes to show how many people are still yet to pay with an editable interface to customise future messages should the bill amount go up or down
